# Nobel-Prize-Project

###  Nobel Prize Project
A simple visualization and anaylsis of Nobel Prize winners. I use Seaborn to plot multiple data categories to highlight the relationship between the values.

I hope you get a sense of my ability to probe the data, using visulations to understand it, and shape it for use of anaylsis. It is awfully simple, but even the "simplest 
solution is often the best" (Occam's Razor).
